- 👋 Hi, I’m @FilkerZero, aka Daniel A. Glasser.
- 👀 I’m interested in a lot of things, but what's relevent here is embedded platforms, music, and some tcl/tk stuff.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about using GitHub, though I've been doing embedded software for more than 40 years at this point
- 💞️ I'm interested in hearing from KevinLawson/KevinLawson about contributing to KeveinLawson/Atomthreads
- 📫 Contact me through my GitHub profile
